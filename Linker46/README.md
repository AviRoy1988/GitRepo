Linker is a _really_ simple web-based URL shortening service.

## Background
When I set out to create a [Pluralsight course](http://bit.ly/ps-cake) about my favorite built tool, [Cake](https://cakebuild.net), I needed a .NET web application for my demos. The idea of the course was to take an existing web app and show how to use Cake to create a *build* and *deployment* pipeline for it from scratch. By the end, you'd have a Cake script that can take the application all the way from source code to running software. That idea eventually became [*Building and Deploying Applications with Cake*](http://bit.ly/ps-cake), which you can read more about [here](https://megakemp.com/2017/10/20/cake-at-pluralsight/).

Back to the app. Right off the bat, I had three requirements for it:

1. Be simple
2. Be realistic
3. Don't be boring

In other words, I wanted an app that *felt* realisticâ€”alas, not the ASP.NET MVC sample applicationâ€”but also simple enough so not to become a [cognitive burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load). The last thing you want in a course (or presentation) is to spend half of the time explaining the domain of your *demo* app to the audience.

Of course, I could have gone for one of the classics like the music collection database or the online pet store we all know too well. But I wanted something *fun* and, if possible, *useful*.

You would never guess what I ended up making: a URL shortening service. Meet [Linker](http://lnker.net).

## Overview

Linker consists of a RESTful API backed by a database and consumed by a web frontend. Here's an overview:

![Linker's Architecture](https://megakemp.com/assets/cake-at-pluralsight/demo-application.png)

This repository contains the complete source code, with tests and everything. Of course, there's also the complete [build and deployment script](https://github.com/ecampidoglio/Linker/blob/53dfd94147e6ea9f408190901eeefb6332cc57b2/build.cake) written with Cake.

## Platform

Since Cake is cross-platform, Linker should be as well. So I wrote two versions of it:

* One that runs only on Windows on top of the [.NET Framework 4.6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/)
* One that runs on Windows, macOS or Linux built on top of [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/get-started)

You'll find the Windows-only version in the `master` branch, while the cross-platform one is in a branch called `netcore`.

## What to Do with It

Although Linker came into existence to serve the needs of my Pluralsight course [Building and Deploying Applications with Cake](http://bit.ly/ps-cake), it has proven to be equally useful for other educational purposes. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that if you ever need a demo app for a course, a talk or a workshop, you should feel free to use Linker for it. After all, it's just a simpleâ€”although completeâ€”ASP.NET web app.

By the way, if you see any way you could improve it, pull requests are always welcome. ðŸš€
